# Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing and orchestrating containerized applications at scale, but as applications grow in complexity, it can become challenging to maintain visibility into their performance and behavior. This is where observability comes in. By gathering and analyzing data from a system, observability tools can help you monitor and troubleshoot your Kubernetes cluster to ensure that your applications are running smoothly.

There are several popular observability tools available for monitoring a Kubernetes cluster, including Grafana-Mimir, Loki, Jaeger, and Kube-Prometheus-Stack.

**Grafana-Mimir** is an open-source observability platform that provides a unified view of your system's metrics, logs, and traces. It integrates with a wide range of data sources, making it easy to aggregate and visualize data from across your Kubernetes cluster.

**Loki** is a horizontally scalable, highly available log aggregation system that is designed to be both cost-effective and easy to operate. It was built specifically for cloud-native environments like Kubernetes and integrates seamlessly with Grafana-Mimir.

**Kube-Prometheus-Stack** is a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules that are designed to provide comprehensive monitoring for your Kubernetes cluster. It includes pre-configured dashboards for a wide range of Kubernetes components, making it easy to get started with monitoring.

**Beyla** is A tool that enables automatic instrumentation of applications to collect telemetry data without the need for manual code changes.

**OpenTelemetry-Collector** is a vendor-neutral framework for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to various backends.

**Tempo-Distributed**  tracing backend designed for large-scale environments, supporting open-source tracing protocols and designed to work seamlessly with Grafana.

**Promtail**: A log shipping agent designed to help Loki collect logs from various sources, such as container logs. It automatically discovers and tail logs from Kubernetes pods and forwards them to Loki for aggregation.


To get started with these tools, you will need a Kubernetes cluster. You can use a local development cluster like Minikube or a cloud-based solution like Amazon EKS or Google Kubernetes Engine. Once you have a cluster set up, you can follow these steps to get started with observability:

Install Grafana-Mimir, Loki, Beyla , and Kube-Prometheus-Stack OpenTelemetry-Collector, Tempo-Distributed using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Instructions for installing each tool can be found in their respective official documentation.
Configure the tools to work together by following the instructions in the Grafana-Mimir documentation.
Explore the pre-configured dashboards provided by Kube-Prometheus-Stack to gain insights into the performance and behavior of your Kubernetes cluster.
